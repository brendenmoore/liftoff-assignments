## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Kettles Coordinator App serves as an administrative tool for the Salvation Army's annual Red Kettle fundraising campaign. Each year, the Salvation Army raises money for its charity work by stationing the iconic red kettles and bell ringers outside of stores during the holidy season. In large areas such as Tampa, there are a lot of logistics involved when dealing with hundreds of stores, kettles, and bell ringers. 
This app allows organizers of this campaign to register bell ringers, create routes with store locations, and assign bell ringers to these locations. This app comes from my own experience working as an assistant kettles coordinator and my desire to solve routine scheduling problems more efficiantly.

### Features
1. *Create Ringers*: The coordinater can create and update a list of everyone who is signed up to ring bells. Phone numbers can be included with each ringer for convenience.
2. *Create Locations*: A list of store locations containing the name of the store and the street address.
3. *Create Routes*: The user can group locations into routes, which are simply a list of locations in a particular order. These routes are used for coordinating drop-off and pick up of ringers and kettles.
4. *Assign Ringers to Locations*: Ringers in the database can be added to a specific location to designate that they will be working at that site.
